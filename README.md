# 💼 My Portfolio Site

This is a basic **React-based personal portfolio website** I created when I first started learning React. The goal was to build a clean, responsive, and modern-looking site to showcase my projects and briefly introduce myself as a developer.

> 🔰 This project reflects my early steps into the world of React and front-end development.
